# GSS Happiness Analysis — Phase 1-2 Decision Memo

**Date:** December 2025  
**Data:** General Social Survey (GSS)  
**Analysis Period:** 2010–2022 (13 years, 5,500 respondents)

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis examines US happiness trends using ordinal self-reported happiness from the GSS, weighted by WTSSPS survey weights. We identify core predictors and flag data quality considerations for Phase 3 modeling.

---

## Data & Methodology

### Target Variable: HAPPY
- **Definition:** Self-reported general happiness level (3-category ordinal)
- **Categories:** "VERY HAPPY" (30.8%), "PRETTY HAPPY" (49.6%), "NOT TOO HAPPY" (19.6%)
- **Coding:** Ordinal (VH > PH > NTH) for modeling
- **Missing:** 0% (no missing values in clean sample)

### Weight Variable
- **WTSSPS:** Postratification weight (all GSS years), applied to all trend and crosstab analyses
- **Rationale:** Corrects for survey design, non-response, and demographic shifts

### Core Predictors (Confirmed in Extract)
1. **AGE** — Continuous, ~0.3% missing
2. **SEX** — Binary (Male/Female)
3. **EDUC** — Years of education, ~10.5% missing (Numeric codes 98=NA, 99=NA recoded)
4. **INCOME** — Annual income, ~0% missing (Numeric code 0=Refusal recoded as NA in Phase 2)
5. **MARITAL** — Categorical (Married, Never married, Divorced, Widowed)
6. **HEALTH** — Self-rated (Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor)
7. **WRKSTAT** — Employment status (Full-time, Part-time, Retired, Unemployed)
8. **PARTYID** — Party identification (Democrat, Republican, Independent)
9. **RACE** — Race/ethnicity (White, Black, Asian, Other)
10. (Tentative) **REGION** *or* **RELIGION** — Expand to 10th predictor TBD

### Extended Predictor (Non-Core)
- **RELIG** — Religion/spirituality, ~20.5% missing year-over-year
  - **Note:** High missingness suggests item non-response or skip pattern; missingness mechanism (MCAR vs. MAR) must be documented before inclusion in modeling
  - Deferred to Phase 3 after missingness analysis

---

## Key Findings: Phase 1–2

### Missingness Patterns
- **High missingness (>20%):** RELIG (~20%), some EDUC variation
- **Stable across years:** No sudden drops or jumps indicating methodological changes
- **Recommendation:** Variables with <5% missing are safe for analysis; document RELIG mechanism

### Weighted Happiness Trend (2010–2022)
- **Overall:** Stable with modest year-to-year variation
- **2021–2022 note:** GSS underwent mode/methodology change (COVID-era modifications, online option expanded). Results for 2021–2022 should be interpreted with caution and compared to 2010–2020 baseline when possible.

### Key Associations (Weighted Crosstabs)
1. **HEALTH ↔ HAPPY:** Clear gradient (Excellent → Very Happy; Poor → Not Too Happy)
2. **MARITAL ↔ HAPPY:** Married respondents highest happiness, Divorced/Widowed lower
3. **INCOME ↔ HAPPY:** Positive association (higher income → more happiness), non-linear

## Data Quality Guardrails

### Validation Rules (Enforced in Preprocessing)
- **Minimum N:** 5,000 cases (met: 5,500)
- **Year span:** ≥5 years (met: 13 years, 2010–2022)
- **Weight column:** WTSSPS present, numeric, >0 for all cases
- **YEAR:** Integer-only (non-integer values rejected)

### Missing-Code Recoding (Variable-Specific)
- **Global:** String tokens (IAP, DK, NA, REFUSED) → NA for all object columns
- **Variable-specific numeric codes:**
  - EDUC: 98, 99 → NA
  - AGE: 98, 99 → NA
  - INCOME: 0, 98, 99 → NA
- **Not recoded:** HEALTH, WRKSTAT, MARITAL (mutually exclusive categories)

---

## Next Steps (Phase 3)

1. **Finalize 10th predictor:** Decide REGION vs. RELIG expansion
2. **Missingness mechanism:** Analyze RELIG skip patterns (MCAR assumption)
3. **Ordinal regression:** Proportional odds or generalized ordinal logit
4. **Robustness:** Weighted vs. unweighted comparison; 2010–2020 vs. full-sample results
5. **Narrative & LinkedIn captions** (Principal Analyst)

---

## Assumptions & Limitations

- **Ordinal assumption:** Happiness categories treated as ordered (VH > PH > NTH)
- **Survey design:** WTSSPS corrects design effects; stratified/clustered design not explicitly modeled
- **2021–2022 comparability:** Mode/method changes; recommend separate sensitivity analysis
- **Non-response:** Implicit assumption that remaining non-response is MCAR after weighting (verify with RELIG)
- **Cross-sectional:** Time trends are descriptive, not causal

## Approval Sign-Off

- [ ] **Principal Analyst:** Confirms assumptions, variable shortlist, and interpretations
- [ ] **Builder/Implementation:** Confirms all preprocessing checks passed, reproducibility verified
